# TA ZEN - Code Beautifier

A theme-driven code beautifier that turns snippets into clean, shareable visuals with language-aware highlighting.

## Features
- Auto-detects common languages (JS/TS, Python, C/C++, Java, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, Shell, SQL, HTML/XML, CSS, JSON, YAML, Markdown).
- SVG-inspired themes with transparent UI and gradient export cards.
- Adjustable padding, window style, and line numbers.
- Export to image via html2canvas.

## Project Structure
- `css/` is split by base, layout, components, themes, and responsive styles.
- `js/` uses small modules (under 100 lines each) with separate language detection and token rules.
